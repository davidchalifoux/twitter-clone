This is a simple Twitter clone built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for LOMA.

## Getting Started

The API expects a valid [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/) `BEARER_TOKEN` variable in the local `.env` file.

Once your environment file is setup, you can run the development server using:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
